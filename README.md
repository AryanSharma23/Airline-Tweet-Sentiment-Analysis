Airline industry had a very hard time post covid to sustain their business due to a long hault. It is very important for them to make sure they exceed customer expectations. The best way to evaluate performance is customer feedback. You are given a dataset of airline tweets from real customers.

A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

You will use the text column and sentiment column to create a classification model that classifies a given tweet into one of the 3 classes - positive, negative, neutral.
